# utils
Utility tools in some programming languages I love.

## Tools found here

- pomodoro-django: a pomodoro timer written in django (TODO)
- xkb-xml-parser.py: a script to add a custom keyboard to the XML (TODO)
  - the target XML file is `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml`
    - you need to update this file to load a custom xkb keyboard layout for use on DE (KDE in my case)
    - after an update of the XML and a reboot, the layout can be found from GUI softwares
- earth-coords: convert decimal coordinates "00.00 degrees" into "00 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds"
  - This is useful when exploring places using digital applications like Google Earth.
  - The degrees/minutes/seconds format is used on real (and traditional) maps.
- convert-unit: convert units of length
  - Miles, nautical miles, kilometers, meters, etc.
